                                The power of corporations and nations lie in ‘’creative thinking” in the 21st century.<br><br>
                                The service and leisure sectors aim to further the concept of 'healing’ and ‘hue (rest)’ culture by linking the business area of ​​SM Hiplus (devoted to the development of customized products such as electronic card issuance and management, as well as prepaid electronic card toll settlement,) and hotel and golf resort facilities.
